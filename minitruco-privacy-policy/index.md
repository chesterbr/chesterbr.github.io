### MiniTruco Privacy Policy

_**WARNING:** This policy has been phased out and replaced by [a new version](/minitruco-privacy-policy/v2) as of the release of the version 3.00.00 of the app (which introduces online play). Please refer to that one if you use that version if you use that version or any one above._

**TL;DR** I don't collect data. Heck, I don't even have a server these days!

For some oddball reason, Google Play requires me to state a privacy policy, even though miniTruco doesn't collect any data. So here it is. Nothing. Nada.

The app doesn't even connect to the internet (its oldest Java incarnation used to, but I never bothered to migrate that, and I won't until I deal with the other more important things I have to implement).
