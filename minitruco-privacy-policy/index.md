### MiniTruco Privacy Policy

**TL;DR** I don't collect data. Heck, I don't even have a server these days!

For some oddball reason, Google Play requires me to state a privacy policy, even though miniTruco doesn't collect any data. So here it is. Nothing. Nada.

The app doesn't even connect to the internet (its oldest Java incarnation used to, but I never bothered to migrate that, and I won't until I deal with the other more important things I have to implement).
