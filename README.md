# chesterbr.github.io

My blog and personal website, powered by GitHub Pages / Jenkins and canonically served at https://chester.me

(with a little help from DigitalOcean, until GitHub supports HTTPS on custom domains - *now* I have personal motivation to poke people about this :sweat_smile:)

It used to be Octopress-based (and before that WordPress, and before that Movable Type... turtles all the way down to BLiG, a custom-made system from the ISP/Portal I worked on in 2002).

As a result of those migrations there are lots of loose files and redirect shenanigans, so you may want to think twice before using it as an inspiration to anything. That said, here it is.
