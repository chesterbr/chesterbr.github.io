# chesterbr.github.io

My blog / personal website, powered by GitHub Pages & Jekyll, and canonically served at https://chester.me.

It used to be Octopress-based (and before that WordPress, and before that Movable Type... turtles all the way down to BLiG, a custom-made system from the ISP/Portal I worked on in 2002).

As a result of those migrations, there are lots of loose files and redirect shenanigans, so you may want to think twice before using it as an inspiration to anything. That said, here it is.

### Quick reminders

- [Jekyll Blogging instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/08-blogging/), because I always forget that stuff.

- `bundle exec jekyll --incremental` will start the server with reasonably fast rebuilds.
