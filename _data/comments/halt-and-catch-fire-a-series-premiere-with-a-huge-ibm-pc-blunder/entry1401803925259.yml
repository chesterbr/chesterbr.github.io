message: '<p>Ah, good catch. I use the terms interchangeably because both are identical from a software perspective. The 8088 is an 8086 with a memory bus that is compatible with older (i.e., cheaper) memory chips due to a reduced data bus (details: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088">http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...</a> ), which makes it indifferent for the sake of the BIOS code discussion, and I''m pretty sure there wasn''t a separate manual for the 8088.</p><p>But technically you are right, and it''s totally worth adding a footnote for that in the post. Thanks! :-)</p>'
