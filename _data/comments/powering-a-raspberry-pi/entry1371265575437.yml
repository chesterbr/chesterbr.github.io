message: '<p>The reason why Apple adapters doesn''t feed properly the Raspberry Pi is NOT that they are not "robust" as you say. They are CHARGERS (not only "adapters"), and they are clever and they try to provide the adequate voltage and current for charging the battery of Apple devices. And the voltage provided varies while the battery is getting charged. So, they are not designed for continous feeding of devices such as raspberry pi and the behaviour could be not as expected (as in your tests).</p>'
