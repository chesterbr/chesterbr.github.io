message: '<p>From <a href="http://eLinux.org" rel="nofollow noopener" title="eLinux.org">eLinux.org</a> "Verified Peripherals" for RaspBerry Pi:</p><p>"Note that apple designs its charger products to work optimally as chargers, in practice this means that apple chargers drop their output voltages somewhat with output current, so that the charging circuits do not need to dissipate more heat than is strictly necessary. Because of this, and although many people have reported apple products to power their basic PI setup reliably, its still not an optimal choice for a PI system that uses power hungry USB devices"</p><p>If I know that behaviour, I wouldn''t expect such a charger to work as a power source. BlackBerry or other brands can do, but it is not a sign of Apple charger should do. BlackBerry has not thinked about reduce voltage when it is not needed, because it is cheaper to don''t do it. It is good for using it with RPi, but worse for the charger itself and probably, the blackberry battery too. Anyway, not a "robustness" problem (yes... you say it in the video).</p><p>Look: <a href="http://www.righto.com/2012/05/apple-iphone-charger-teardown-quality.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.righto.com/2012/05/apple-iphone-charger-teardown-quality.html">http://www.righto.com/2012/...</a></p><p>Overpriced? Perhaps. Lacking of robustness? No!</p>'
