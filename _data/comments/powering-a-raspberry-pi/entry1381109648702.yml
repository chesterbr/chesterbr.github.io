message: '<p>Hi! First of all, thanks for the correction - my Japanese is pretty crude, and I just wanted to grab the attention of a reader that was not paying much.</p><p>I have personally seen the occasional reboot while doing heavy (for Pi standards) stuff, like playing videos.. With the new power source, I have at least one Pi running for months (a server for a game, which might be featured on a future post). I''d recommend that you consider a pre-tested one - I''m not sure about Japan, but $10 would be a decent price here in Canada.</p><p>Good luck!</p>'
