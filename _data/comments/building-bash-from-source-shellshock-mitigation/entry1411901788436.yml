message: '<p>Thank you for this guide. I have one problem after exchanging the old bash with the new bash: whenever I open a screen session the /etc/profile won´t be parsed anymore. I can load it with source /etc/profile but it would be great if there is a way to make it work again. It´s an older Suse Linux, so I cannot use a rpm. I was looking at the configure options and couldn´t find any option that is controlling the behaviour where to look for the profile. Any help would be great. Thank you.</p>'
