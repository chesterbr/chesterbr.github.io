message: "Hi Chester,\r\n\r\nI hope this message finds you well. I recently came across your blog and read about your journey to Canada back in 2012. As someone aspiring to make a similar move, I found your insights incredibly valuable.\r\n\r\nI'm currently exploring opportunities to relocate to Canada, particularly as a software developer. I understand that the landscape may have evolved since your relocation, but I believe your seasoned perspective could offer invaluable guidance.\r\n\r\nI've been diligently searching through platforms like LinkedIn and VanHack, and I'm also planning to attend virtual job fairs, such as the one scheduled for March in Newfoundland and Labrador. Additionally, I've been exploring opportunities in Quebec through Quebec en TÃªte.\r\n\r\nHowever, I've noticed that many Canadian employers seem to prefer candidates already in the country, which poses a challenge for me, especially considering the currency conversion from Brazilian Real to Canadian Dollar.\r\n\r\nGiven your experience and insights, I was wondering if you could share any advice or perhaps recommend companies or avenues that may be open to hiring individuals from Brazil. Any guidance or tips you could offer would be immensely appreciated as I navigate this process.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for taking the time to read this message. I truly admire your journey and would be grateful for any assistance you could provide.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nChristian Chiavelli"
