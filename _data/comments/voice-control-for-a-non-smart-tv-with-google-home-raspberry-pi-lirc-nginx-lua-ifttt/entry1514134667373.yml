message: '<p>This was very helpful, and encouraging. There is a nice little IR daughterboard available on Amazon that I might try out if I can''t get CEC working with my ca. 2010 Samsung LCD. And Home Assistant, which runs on RPi might be able to make some of what you did easier to install, if way more bloated. Then there''s Stringify too. So much to explore. Thanks!</p>'
