message: '<p>This is such a great thread! I''m trying to implement this on my Magic Mirror project. My goal is to make my mirror entirely Google integrated. However, I can''t seem to understand the configuration process. Can you please explain the "my.domain" part. Is this a web domain that you own? I don''t understand how the IR blaster is triggered. I''m fairly new to coding. Please bare with me. :(</p>'
