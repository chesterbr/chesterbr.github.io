message: '<p>Hello Bryan!</p><p>First of all "my.domain" there is the (example of a) free name I registered with <a href="https://www.no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.no-ip.com">https://www.no-ip.com</a> (so that IFTTT can reach my network). So if, say, you go there and register `<a href="http://coolname.ddns.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="coolname.ddns.net">coolname.ddns.net</a>` and want to set up nginx to respond to that, name your file `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/<a href="http://coolname.ddns.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="coolname.ddns.net">coolname.ddns.net</a>` and also replace the "my.domain" occurrences with `<a href="http://coolname.ddns.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="coolname.ddns.net">coolname.ddns.net</a>`</p><p>The 3 B+ should be super fine (I''m using a *way* olderRaspberry Pi 1 B), and I also use Raspbian, so your setup is good.</p><p>If you recorded the remote commands with the `irrecord` utility, you must have saved them a file ending with `.lirc.conf` (see <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/irrecord.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.lirc.org/html/irrecord.html">http://www.lirc.org/html/ir...</a> "Description" session for details). Copy that file to the `/etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d/` directory and restart lirc (easiest way is to reboot your Pi via Raspbian), and you should be able to send commands using:</p><p>`irsend SEND_ONCE device_name command`</p><p>where `device_name` is the name you supplied to `irrecord` (it will be on the `name` section of the config file it generated) and `command` is the key you want to send (they are all listed after `begin codes` in that file, e.g., `KEY_POWER`)</p><p>Let me know if you have any other questions!</p>'
