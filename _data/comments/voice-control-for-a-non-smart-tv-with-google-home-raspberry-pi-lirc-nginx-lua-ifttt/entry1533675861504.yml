message: '<p>Yup, the replacement is correct. You will need a certificate to ensure communications are encrypted (otherwise someone could grab your secrets and control your outlets - not much incentive in that, but there is the possibility) - not sure if it *must* be a "real" one (from the likes of letsencrypt) or a self-signed would do (depends on IFTTT playing nice).</p><p>You should be done if you can can access <a href="https://mirror.ddns.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://mirror.ddns.net">https://mirror.ddns.net</a> (or whichever is your name) from a browser outside your network - even if it shows some standard nginx "you need to configure this" message. A self-signed cert will show some "!"s on the browser bar but should still be good, but if you have done the certbot setup, <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">https://www.ssllabs.com/ssl...</a> will both check that your RPi is accessible and secure, from an SSL point of view.</p>'
