message: '<p>Hi! Unfortunately a *local* IP won''t do, because those IPs are only unique inside your local network (e.g., my computer may have the same local IP as yours, and IFTTT, being outside our homes, needs to know which of us to talk to).</p><p>But you **can** use your router''s public IP address (sites like <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://whatismyipaddress.com/">https://whatismyipaddress.com/</a> will tell which one it is) as long as you configure the router to redirect that IP and designated port to your local IP. It will work until your IP changes (which is why I suggest registering a dynamic DNS), but it should be enough for a local test.</p>'
