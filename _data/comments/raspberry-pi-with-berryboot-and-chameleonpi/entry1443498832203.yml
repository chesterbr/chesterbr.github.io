message: '<p>Anyway, taking a look I see ChameleonPI has not been updated in a few years, so it may not even be worth trying to fit it into your BerryBoot. I''d suggest trying something like RetroPie instead <a href="http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/">http://blog.petrockblock.co...</a> , which has support for many more systems. Please let me know if that suits your interest better.</p>'
