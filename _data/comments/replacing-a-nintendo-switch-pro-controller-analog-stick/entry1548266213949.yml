message: '<p>I received my order from ebay and the number on the side was "70 3E". Batch number sounds like a reasonable guess for what these mean. Regardless, after installing this one the joystick worked perfectly and could be calibrated! Other than the number on the side this item looked identical to the one I received from amazon. Maybe it got a little to hot when I tried to solder the first one or the part was just incorrect. Thanks for the tip on this repair Chester, glad to have my pro controller back to 100%!</p>'
