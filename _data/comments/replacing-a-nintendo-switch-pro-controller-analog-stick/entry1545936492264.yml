message: '<p>I just tried replacing the joystick on my pro controller that was having random drift issues. I bought the replacement from another seller and like the other poster here, the replacement doesn''t have full range of motion and can''t reach the outside of the circle to calibrate. The number on the original part was "63 6E" and the new one was "73 7h". Not sure what these mean but I''m ordering one from the source in this post and will try again.</p>'
