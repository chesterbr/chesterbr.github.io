message: '<p>So how were the results using the replacement joystick? I recently did this myself using one from a different seller, but the capable range on mine is quite a bit lower than the original; doesn''t reach as far and needs software calibration. I need to test on another Switch since mine is broken currently.<br>I think it''s important to detail the side with "ALPS" says "73 4E" instead of on the originals saying "76 1E" even in another video teardown. I also have another with "73 6E" The bottom of the joysticks also have identification, but I''ve already soldered the "73 4E" in; original says "4 H" and my extra says "2 A"</p>'
