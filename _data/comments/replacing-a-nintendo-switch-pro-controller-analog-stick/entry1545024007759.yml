message: '<p>Hey, mine also required the software calibration, but once I did, it worked 100% - on the calibration screen it stays centered, and I can reach any point on the circle with ease. But maybe I''m not as sensitive to the range as you are (I was mostly concerned with the controller drifting on its own, which doesn''t happen anymore), unless you didn''t get the same results (in that case, it may be a faulty / bad part, I suppose).</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn''t really think about checking the numbers (and I didn''t save the original one), but I just (naively) assumed it would work. Hope you can figure it out!</p>'
