message: '<p>I was able to test on a working Switch (need to repair mine) and calibration is not possible due to the short reach of this replacement. Though, connecting to my PC via Bluetooth and using Windows controller calibration showed results nearly perfect with only a little more jitter on the deadzone in comparison. Since the Switch was unable to perform calibration using its own way, this joystick is effectively useless to me. I''ve already started a dispute with the seller and ordered from another which supposedly tested theirs, supported by the pictures listed being original and having solder left on some pins. I''ll likely be soldering on the "73 6E" very soon to test it out.</p><p>I also confirmed that despite another teardown having "76 1E," just like mine, my cousin''s controller was "72 6E." Due to this, it is my conclusion that there are some selling defective parts thrown by Nintendo that don''t meet Nintendo''s standard. I do not doubt the ones I got are authentic ALPS joysticks, but mine seems to have been a bad batch sold as original and new.</p><p>I''ll keep logging here more details of this venture.</p>'
