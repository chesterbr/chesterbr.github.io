message: '<p>Hey,<br>I''m following your series of articles and finding it very useful. <br>I assume after all this time you won''t need this, but for the benefit of future readers, the problem you are having with seeing 0xFFFB and 0xFFFC instead of 0xFFFC and 0xFFFD is a line of code in your Arduino monitor:</p><p><code>address_value += digitalRead(bit + 2) * pow(2, bit);<br></code><br>Change that for:</p><p><code>address_value |= (digitalRead(bit+2) &lt;&lt; bit);</code></p><p>And everything will make sense.</p><p>Thanks again for the articles!</p>'
