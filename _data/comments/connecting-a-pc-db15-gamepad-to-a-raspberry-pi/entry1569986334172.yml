message: '<p>I am trying to build a robot using raspberry pi somewhat similar to line follower. I was wondering if it is possible to connect ns joy con to raspberry pi and use them to send signal to robot. I searched a lot and found pybluez might be helpful. But not sure how to use it to read signal from joy con connected to raspberry pi using bluetooth. Any advice.</p>'
