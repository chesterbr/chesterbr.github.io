message: '<p>Gibo, I''m by no means a CV/Resum√© expert, and I''ll assume you refer to resumes (in Portuguese we call them "CVs" also, but here the term is used for academic ones). That said, I would do it just like you''d do to any Euro-American company, that is:</p><p>- Avoid unnecessary personal information (no pictures, marital status, age, address, etc.);<br>- Have the usual sections (short abstract, education/courses, relevant experience, projects) and size (2 pages unless you''re Chuck Norris);</p><p>- On a cover letter, explain your current and planned work situation. E.g. "I current live in X, but am willing to move/remote work, and I would need sponsorship" or "I applied for immigration and expect to arrive in Canada in Y", etc.<br>- Never lie, but prioritize/detail according to the company/position. E.g., some will value academia - you should include (or pursue) standardized test results and details on your academic life. Others will focus on experience, so you will want to put that first. IT companies will be looking for languages/technologies/certification buzzwords, so include those (for tech you *actually* know).<br>- For some companies, you''ll be better with a LinkedIn profile and a well-written email in lieu of a resume/cover letter (but have the resume ready just in case).</p><p>Honestly, I recommend you google around - not only for actual resume building tips and examples from people that know what they are doing/are more intimate to the industry you are pursuing, but also for information on the companies/jobs you are looking for. Good luck.</p>'
