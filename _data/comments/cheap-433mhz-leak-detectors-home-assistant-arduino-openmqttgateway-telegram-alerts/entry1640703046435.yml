I''ve heard there are other software bundles these days to consider, and got particularly interested in ESPHome (<a href="https://esphome.io" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://esphome.io">https://esphome.io</a>) for the easy Home Assistant integration, but OpenMQTTGateway has been so stable (other than restarting it from time to time; I only remember it exists when I need to add some other capability) that I''ll resist to switching.</p>'
