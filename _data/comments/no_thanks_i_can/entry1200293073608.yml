message: '<p>You hit the nail on the head. Web apps can be quite addictive, once you make that mental transition. For people who have a long history with desktop apps, making that transition can be hard. But for people without such an invested history, the default expectation is going to be a web app.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Why would anyone make a transition? For me personally, web apps just seem to fit my profile naturally - I am usually too lazy to do backups (and I know I am not the only one!), and in a multi-computer household, web apps are just so easy to get on and off. It is just easier to borrow my wife''s already-on laptop to check mail quickly, for example, rather than wake my own laptop from sleep. These seem like small advantages, but they actually add up.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This is similar to the way people seem to naturally switch from land phones to mobile phones over time, without consciously realizing it. Of course, for young kids, mobile phones are the only ones they will ever know.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Sridhar Vembu<br><br>Zoho<br><br></p>'
