message: '<p>To anyone who owns this router the 3700 v3 I recommend using DD-WRT.   Its not hard to go from factory to dd-wrt if you upload this file first from the netgear factory firmware.<br><a href="ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/betas/2015/01-20-2015-r25974/broadcom_K26/dd-wrt.v24-25974_NEWD-2_K2.6_mini-WNDR3700v3.chk" rel="nofollow noopener" title="ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/betas/2015/01-20-2015-r25974/broadcom_K26/dd-wrt.v24-25974_NEWD-2_K2.6_mini-WNDR3700v3.chk">ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/betas/...</a></p><p>Then wait for it to program and reboot. IT will take about 4 minutes or so before you can access the router setup page at 192.168.1.1  it will make you change the user name and password.  <br>Then to get the latest build that works for this you will need to upload this one here.<br>This one give USB NAS support.  <br><a href="ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/betas/2017/08-25-2017-r33215/broadcom_K3X/dd-wrt.v24-33215_NEWD-2_K3.x_mega-nv64k.bin" rel="nofollow noopener" title="ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/betas/2017/08-25-2017-r33215/broadcom_K3X/dd-wrt.v24-33215_NEWD-2_K3.x_mega-nv64k.bin">ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/betas/...</a>   then wait again about 4 to 5 minutes.  Then setup your wifi password and other things you want.  <br>There is 2 more newer releases that came out at the time of this writing.  They both suffer a reboot loop in which you have to serial connect like its shown here to restore it.     I heard of  Tomato firmware but never used it.</p>'
