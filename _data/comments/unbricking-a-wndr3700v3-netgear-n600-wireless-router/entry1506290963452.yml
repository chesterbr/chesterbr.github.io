message: '<p>Yes, I have a different board layout; even though I have that same 6 pin connector as you and Chester have on my board, the connections didn''t work, but the 4 pin connector next to it did.</p><p>I don''t have other routers to recover - and this is the only WNDR3700 I have at all.  The others are just various spare routers, great for little projects like wireless ethernet bridges (connect your desktop PC to your WiFi without wires, without a separate wireless card).  Most of my spares already have Tomato.  It''s really much more stable and reliable and easier to use than DD-WRT, which I used for a few years prior to discovering Tomato.  Unfortunately, Tomato is targeted at fewer hardware platforms, so it''s just not an option for a lot of other routers.</p><p>I did try OpenWRT briefly on this WNDR3700v3, but it looks a bit raw, so I put it aside for now.  I''d like to get one little function working in DD-WRT with it but can''t figure it out just now.  A project for another day...</p>'
