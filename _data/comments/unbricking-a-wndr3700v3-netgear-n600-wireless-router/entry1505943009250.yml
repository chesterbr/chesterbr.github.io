message: '<p>On my Netgear the pinout was  6 was ground 5 was either TX or RX and pin 2 was either RX or TX.  I got the adapters with the wires attached.  There was four colors and it was Black on 6  White on 5 and green on 2.  No need to use the Red or VCC wire with it.     I also helped a guy in Canada unbrick his unit he got for $2.50 on ebay and someone flashed Tomato on it and bricked it.</p><p>As for the DD-wrt they have messed something up something really bad after release r33215 the next 4 newer releases will either brick the router or the router will refuse to flash it.   As for R33215 its been stable. I do not use the QoS service or VPN options.  But the USB port works and wifi signals work and it does not reboot or crash at random.    OpenWrt may work for you. I never used it yet  but you always have my personally tested firmware links if  OpenWrt does not work well for you.   To be honest anything is better than the stock Netgear firmware.</p>'
