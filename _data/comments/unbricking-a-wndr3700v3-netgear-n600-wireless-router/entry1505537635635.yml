message: '<p>Tomato firmware is great in general; unfortunately, there is no working version for the 3700 V3.  Even worse, there *IS* a version that one of the developers compiled and released that, in fact, will BRICK your router (as Chester and I have both learned to our regret).  I am now trying to follow Chester''s instructions to de-brick my router (my PC board is a different rev than his - haven''t got the connections right yet).  I don''t really need to do this; the 3700 V3 router cost me almost nothing and I have a whole pile of spares, but I want to learn how to do this.</p><p>I did try DD-WRT on the 3700 V3 before I foolishly tried the Tomato version and bricked it.  I''ve used DD-WRT in the past and have found it has a lot of features but also is radically inconsistent and unpredictable between routers; some features simply don''t work, others are poorly documented or difficult to use.  Tomato, when you get it working on a router that has a working version, is much more consistent and reliable, so if you get something to work on one router with Tomato, it seems to work with the others.</p><p>If I ever get my 3700 V3 debricked, I''m going to try OpenWRT next on it.</p>'
