message: '<p>Oh I see you got a different revision which has the same version number but the board layout is different.  I believe there was one where you can do the pin short method to force recovery mode.  Since you figured out the serial pinout and got Putty to work which is much safer.  It looks like you got a pile of them to recover right?  They will serve you well. Perhaps flash dd-wrt on one of them to try it out.</p>'
