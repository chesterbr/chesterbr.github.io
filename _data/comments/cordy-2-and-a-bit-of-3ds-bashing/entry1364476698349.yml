NSMB2 is actually quite challenging if your objective is collecting all big coins instead of just finishing the levels.</p><p>Another great platformers for 3DS: Mighty Switch Force (fun and nice use of the 3D feature), Labi Rabi 2 (platformer/puzzle just as difficult as The Castle). Both are available on the online store.</p>'
