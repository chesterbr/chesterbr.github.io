One convenient feature of Chromecast is that it turns on your TV automatically when you connect to it - as long as your TV has HDMI-CEC. Mine doesn't, but it is already [remote-controlled via Raspberry Pi](https://chester.me/archives/2017/12/voice-control-for-a-non-smart-tv-with-google-home-raspberry-pi-lirc-nginx-lua-ifttt/), and thanks to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), I can easily detect when the Chromecast is in use, so in theory I could just blast a command to the IR when it switches away from "off".

There is just one problem: Home Assistant doesn't know whether the TV is on or off. If it is already on when I start casting, sending the command will turn it off - the opposite of what I want. Also, I would like to turn the TV off when not using the Chromecast (something it doesn't seem to do, even with HDMI-CEC).

## Detecting power via USB

I am not the only one: people have already [asked](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/8224/detecting-tv-power-on-off-without-cec
) around, and one of the ideas was to use the USB port (that a lot of sets have for playing media or firmware upgrades). A quick multimeter test on mine showed that it is only powered when the TV is on, so it's just a question of monitoring it and forwarding the info to Home Assistant.

### Attempt 1: Raspberry Pi GPIO (spoiler: üëç for polling, üëé for Home Assistant)

The simplest idea for monitoring the state would be to connect the power output of the TV to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi. However, those pins expect 3.3V, and USB operates at 5V, so a direct connection would fry the RPi. I knew I'd need what is known as a "voltage divider" - a setup that (in its simplest form) uses two resistors to extract a lower voltage from a higher one.

The good news: [someone](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/99197/100572) had already done the homework for me, noticing the Rasperry Pi already provides one of the resistors and calculating the value of the other. So it was as simple as:

- Connecting the TV USB GND to a Pi GND pin (e.g., pin 9);
- Connecting the TV USB 5V to a 4.7k‚Ñ¶ resistor, and the resistor to a Pi GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO17, which is pin 11 [on the board](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/12967/100572));
- Software-enable the pull-down resistor on that pin and read it to know if the TV is on or off.

You can reuse any cable with a USB connector - they are usually [color-coded](https://turbofuture.com/computers/Color-Coded-Wire-inside-the-USB), red being the 5v, and the silver, non-isolated wire is GND. Raspberry Pi pinout is [here](https://turbofuture.com/computers/Color-Coded-Wire-inside-the-USB), but here is my wiring for this setup:

![Schematics of USB-to-Raspberry connection with the resistor that completes the voltage divider](/img/2020/06/tv-usb-raspberry.png){: .center }

To test it, we can invoke `python2` and type some Python code:

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
GPIO.setup(11, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN)
while True:
  print GPIO.input(11)
  time.sleep(1)
```

This prints `1` when the TV is off and `0` when it is off. Here is a test I did plugging and unplugging the USB to a power adaptor:

![](/img/2020/06/power-detection.gif){: .center }

On the actual TV, it takes some time to pick up the "off" state because the TV slowly reduces the output instead of cutting it straight (I checked with a multimeter, it takes quite a few seconds to go from ~5V to ~0).

Anyway, it shows that the hardware works, so we can move on to exposing it in Home Assistant. It will appear on the panel as a [`binary_sensor`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rpi_gpio/) just by adding these lines to the `binary_sensor` section of `configuration.yaml` (creating one if you don't have it):

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: rpi_gpio
    ports:
      17: PIR TV # rpi_gpio uses BCM notation => physical pin 11 = GPIO17
    pull_mode: DOWN
```

And it _almost_ works ü•∫. Even though the sensor shows up on the interface (alongside the Chromecast, on the screenshot), and switches to `on` when I turn the TV on, it does not switch to `off` when I turn the TV off. Never.

![](/img/2020/06/home-assistant-direct-pi-connection.png){: .center }

It happens that (unsurprisingly), Home Assistant [code](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/rpi_gpio/__init__.py#L51) is more efficient than mine, using threaded callbacks instead of checking the state every second ([details](https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Inputs/)).

So I changed my test code to match Home Assistant's:

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
GPIO.setup(11, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN)
def cb(port):
  print GPIO.input(port)
GPIO.add_event_detect(11, GPIO.BOTH, callback=cb, bouncetime=1000)
```

Instead of continuously printing, it will just output the current state when it changes, and works as expected fine when plugging/unplugging from the power adaptor.

When connected to the TV, turning it of produces a "1", but turning it off _also_ produces a "1". It isn't a bounce issue (I tried changing `bouncetime` to no avail).

My other guess is that the state returned by `GPIO.input` isn't updated when the `cb` function is fired by the callback, likely due to the slow discharge. To confirm that, I include a little pause (200ms) on the function before I read the state, and, lo and behold, that fixes the problem. The code above consistently prints "0" when I turn the TV off:

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
GPIO.setup(11, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN)
def cb(port):
  time.sleep(0.2) # Pause for 200ms
  print GPIO.input(port)
GPIO.add_event_detect(11, GPIO.BOTH, callback=cb, bouncetime=1000)
```

I _could_ change the Home Assistant code on the Pi to do that (maybe accepting an optional delay parameter in the same way that it accepts a bounce time), but I had a hard time running their tests, so it will be a while before I can submit a contribution to the project (which may or may not be accepted), so for now I went with ha different approach:

### Attempt 2: Arduino (NodeMcu ESP8266) GPIO (üëç)

To be honest, I haven't been using the Raspberry Pi GPIO for a while precisely because of this type of issue: running I/O on a non-realtime (or at least not very predictable OS) leads to inconsistent reads. Instead, I've switched all the I/O on my home automation to a separate board (a [NodeMcu Lua ESP8266](https://www.dx.com/p/esp8266-esp-12-nodemcu-lua-wifi-internet-things-development-board-esp8266-nodemcu-v3-wireless-module-for-arduino-compatible-black-2016051.html), which behaves like an Arduino, but is more compact _and_ has built-in Wi-Fi).

The board runs [OpenMQTTGateway](https://github.com/1technophile/OpenMQTTGateway), a software that makes it easy to forward hardware events to the Raspberry Pi ([here](https://chester.me/archives/2019/07/cheap-433mhz-leak-detectors-home-assistant-arduino-openmqttgateway-telegram-alerts/) is how I set it up to work with Home Assistant) and brings us the best of two worlds: the stability of the microcontroller and the software flexibility of the Pi.

For this setup, we don't have the Rapsberry-pi-provided pull-down, so we'll need two resistors to provide the voltage divider (i.e., bring the TV USB 5v down to 3.3v that the board can monitor).

There is [a formula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxLKfAZrhbM) that you can use to find a pair of resistors, but I was lazy and just used [this calculator](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/voltage-divider-calculator/), throwing 5V as the voltage input and playing with values until I got a pair that I had lying around (R1 = 75‚Ñ¶ and R2 = 150‚Ñ¶) and gave an approximate 3.3v output.

Here is how I wired them (you must choose a pin you are not using for some other I/O):

![Schematics of USB-to-ESP connection](/img/2020/06/tv-usb-esp.png){: .center }

Opening OpenMQTTGateway's [source code](https://github.com/1technophile/OpenMQTTGateway) in the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), I enabled the monitoring by removing the trailing `//` from this line in `User_config.h`:

```c
#define ZsensorGPIOInput "GPIOInput" //ESP8266, Arduino, ESP32
```

and in `config_GPIOInput.h`, I configured the pin I'm using by adding it to the first `#define` on the block below `PIN_DEFINITIONS` (the correct number [depends on your board](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-pinout-reference-gpios/)). In the one depicted above, D5 means GPIO14, so we'd go with:

```c
#if defined(ESP8266) || defined(ESP32)
  #define GPIOInput_PIN 14
#else
  #define GPIOInput_PIN 7
#endif
```

Of course there are other configurations you may want to change to ensure the software connects to your Wi-Fi network, and that the Raspberry Pi can subscribe to the events published by OpenMQTTGateway (see the docs and [my previous post](https://chester.me/archives/2019/07/cheap-433mhz-leak-detectors-home-assistant-arduino-openmqttgateway-telegram-alerts/)).

Once everything is set up, it is possible to ssh into the Raspberry Pi and monitor the queue with:

```
mosquitto_sub -t \# -v
```

As the TV is turned on and off, the following events appear:

```
home/OpenMQTTGateway/GPIOInputtoMQTT {"gpio":"HIGH"}
home/OpenMQTTGateway/GPIOInputtoMQTT {"gpio":"LOW"}
```

That allowed me to add a `binary_sensor` to Home Assistant's `configuration.yaml`. Like I did with the sensors in the aforementioned post, I used the `mqtt` platform, telling it to watch for the messages above:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Living Room TV Power
    state_topic: "home/OpenMQTTGateway/GPIOInputtoMQTT"
    payload_on: '{"gpio":"HIGH"}'
    payload_off: '{"gpio":"LOW"}'
    device_class: power
```

That makes the switch appear, and this time it reacts to on and off!

## Using the power state as a condition to toggle TV state when Chromecast plays/stops

The final goal is to to monitor my Chromecast (`media_player.living_room_tv`)'s `state`. When it changes from `off` to anything else, I want it to send a power toggle command to my TV (which I defined as the `switch.tv` when I set up IR) - but only if the sensor we just installed says the TV is `off`.

In Home Assistant language, that translates to these lines in `automations.yaml`:

```yaml
- alias: tv_on_when_start_casting
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: media_player.living_room_tv
    from: 'off'
  condition:
    condition: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.living_room_tv_power
    state: 'off'
  action:
  - service: switch.toggle
    entity_id: switch.tv
```

Conversely, if I want it to turn off the TV when I'm done with the Chromecast (and again, only if I haven't turned it off already):

```yaml
- alias: tv_off_when_stop_casting
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: media_player.living_room_tv
    to: 'off'
  condition:
    condition: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.living_room_tv_power
    state: 'on'
  action:
  - service: switch.toggle
    entity_id: switch.tv
```

A few quirks still remain. For example, if I switch sources without giving the setup a few seconds to catch up, the TV will turn off, but not on again. Worse: if I switch to another HDMI source without disconnecting, the Chromecast will become idle after a while, and turn the TV off at the worst possible moment.

But those are likely fixable by tweaking the automations, and in general I just start casting and everything works!
