And OpenSocial 0.7 hits the door. Too sad I don&#8217;t have John Battelle&#8217;s balls to write down and publish [predictions][1], otherwise I could be bragging about having expected &#8220;a serious version not until the end of January&#8221;, as I suggested to a few colleagues. :-P

Taking off the bugfixes, I would like to emphasize the following features (condensed from the [release notes][2]):

</p>
*   **Standardized profile information fields.** (&#8230;) standard fields that you can access about a `Person` (&#8230;) include location, schools, pets, movies, sports, and [more][3].(&#8230;)


*   **Support for viral growth.** (&#8230;) You can invite a user&#8217;s friends to install your application (&#8230;) You can also send an application-specific message (&#8230;)
</ul>
Those were absolute show-stoppers when comparing OpenSocial to FaceBook &#8211; not the only ones, but the most visible. I did not check (yet) how well implemented they are, but at least now they exist &#8211; and that makes 0.7 the most important milestone since the public announcement of OpenSocial.

At the same time of this release, Google announces an important step for <strike>content</strike> container and app developers: the Google Gadgets specification (already used by Orkut and several other containers), which was not per se part of OpenSocial, will have a [reference application][4] handed over to Apache. This clarifies one big source of confusion, signaling the developers with more effective universality for apps developed for the platform.
