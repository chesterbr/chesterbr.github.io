There is no shortage of [documentaries about startups][1], and that is understandable: the idea of bootstraping an idea into a viable enterprise is fascinating, and the reality is filled with real-life sweat, joy and drama that owes nothing to fiction.

Given that, I jumped at the opportunity of watching the premiere of [Day Job][2], which puts under a microscope the journey of three companies through one of the [Extreme Startups][3] accelerator programs. Between the tight schedules and limited budgets, an interesting story ensures. Check the [trailer][4]:

How realistic? Well, after the event we had the opportunity of watching a Q&A with the film's director and the three entrepreneurs, which pretty much backed the film depiction. It is yet unclear how/when the movie will be distributed, but I'd keep an eye if I had not already seen it.
