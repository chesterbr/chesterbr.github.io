[Cordy 2][1] is an extremely beautiful platform game that I&#8217;m playing on the iPad (there is an [Android version][2] as well). The game is fast/challenging at the right measure (at least for my taste) and does its best to offer decent controls on a touch screen.

Levels are managed in the Angry Birds style (you earn 1-3 stars according to your performance on each level), but &#8220;cost&#8221; mechanics ensures you put some effort in a few of them to move forward. Tutorials are very short and mostly skippable, and game dialogs are kept to a minimum. Overall, you just play the game and have fun (a hard-to-find concept in recent games, I guess.)

The fact that you don&#8217;t really &#8220;die&#8221; (at least I haven&#8217;t so far) initially made me afraid the game was too easy. But using other types of punishment (like sending you back a bit) works well, pretty much like the old LucasArts adventure games &#8220;no death/no dead end&#8221; policy gave them a playability edge over Sierra titles and other predecessors.

My only complaint is that I miss hardware controls for platform games (regardless of how beautiful they are on the Retina display). I bought a [Nintendo 3DS][3] precisely for that reason, but never found a great platformer for it (or any title that breaks the &#8220;ok, but not as shiny as the original&#8221; impression).

The only thing that keeps my Nintendo portable running are the Mii Plaza StreetPass-based mini-games, the ultra-polished Mario Kart 7 and the faithfully recreated Twin Bee. [New SMB2][4] had everything to change that, but the &#8220;you-suck-let&#8217;s-make-you-Invincible-Mario&#8221; crushed the experience for me.

Back to Cordy 2: maybe it&#8217;s not for the hardcore gamer, but overall I find the $5 was money well spent. As usual in iOSland, you can try a few levels before making a decision &#8211; yet another thing that very few titles (and none from Nintendo, I believe) offer on the 3DS.
