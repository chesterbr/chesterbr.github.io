[<img src="//chester.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/newsblur.png" alt="NewsBlur" width="200" height="200" class="alignright size-full wp-image-7450" />][1]As a content addict, I&#8217;ve always sought tools that ease its consumption, from primitive ones such as [PointCast][2], [Plucker][3] and [Hands][4] to modern-day RSS aggregators like Google Reader.

Reader&#8217;s efficient handling of feeds, flexible ordering (a must for webcomics) and read post tracking pretty much killed competition on this arena years ago. But hegemony is [seldom a good thing in software][5], and bad calls like the [stubborn push][6] of a GMail-like UI and the abandonment [symptoms][7] (recently [explained][8] by an ex-PM) made the [retirement announce][9] my personal wake-up call to find a better solution.

After evaluating quite a few self-hosted and third-party options, I chose [NewsBlur][1]. It&#8217;s a well-crafted (mostly by a [single developer][10]), [open-source][11] and **excellent** service, with all the bells and whistles Reader had on its best days. It even includes social features, not unlike the ones one that Google axed in favor of paltry Google+ buttons (which are only useful if your target audience is limited to Google employees and Facebook denialists).

It also packs trainable filters to show/hide content (not my turf, but they seem good), and a nice touch for webcomics and sites with partial feeds: you can set up those to display the original content in-place. The [iPad app][12] is also neat &#8211; a **way** better proposition than Reader&#8217;s (yet more) anemic mobile browser interface.

Due to the massive influx of Reader refugees, it doesn&#8217;t offer free accounts right now, but you can play with a simulated account on their homepage and get a good grasp of the real thing. You have to pay for one year upfront, but it&#8217;s only $2/month &#8211; a small and more than deserved fee for such a lovely piece of work.

Unless, of course, you believe RSS is dead(*). In that case, never mind.

*(*) hint: you shouldn&#8217;t. Its death is announced [so often][13] that it could easily get mistaken for a [modern comics character][14].*
