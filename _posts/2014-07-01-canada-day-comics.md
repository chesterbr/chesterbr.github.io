That isn't true: to honor the spirit of the day, I've been lazily reading **Canada-related** comic books (by author or subject).

Having already read everything from [Alpha Flight][2] on Marvel Unlimited, I've started with Sam Logan's [Sam and Fuzzy][4] (one of my favorite webcomics of all time) and two [Ty Templeton][5] works: the latest [Batman'66 meets The Green Hornet][6] (a team-up brought by a team-up with Kevin Smith and Ralph Garman) and [The Northern Guard][7].

The biggest surprise, however, was [Archie Goes to Canada][8]: it collects stories from multiple periods that are not (much) stereotypical, and even doubles as a cultural/travel guide of sorts.

But my day wont't be just comics: there is also the
[Captain Canuck animated series][20], available online for free. It is modern-looking and (judging by a peek) very action-oriented, so I expect a very un-canadian punch-to-apology ratio. Anyway, it's the red-and-white that counts, so.... Happy Canada Day!
