I have always cherished [Sam & Max Hit The Road][1] as the best point-and-click adventure of the &#8220;LucasArts years&#8221;, but I had no idea that it had started as a [comic book][2], nor that it had spawned its own [animated series][3].

<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4yWnnk9fyJE"></iframe></p>

And most of all, I was unaware that some former LucasArts employees formed [Telltale Games][4] to bring back those awesome games. They have built a new 3D engine that brings the classic mechanics to the 21st century. I discovered that just as I was moving to Toronto, so I decided that once I settled at my new home, I&#8217;d catch up.

I cut my teeth on the new stuff with [Season 3][5] &#8211; mostly because it was [available for Mac OS on Steam][6]. Got a few spoilers, but instead of turning me off, they made me **more** interested in finding out what happened by playing the previous games than otherwise. I also needed a refreshment, so I gave the original game a spin on [ScummVM][7] (an awesome implementation of the [LucasArts engine][8] for modern computers.)

Once I was convinced that the new games had the soul of the original one, my wish was to start from Season 1, but it&#8217;s only available on Windows, Wii and XBox 360. But [Season 2][9] was released on the iPad. Honestly, I was sure that a game so strongly based on mouse-hovering would flop without a mouse to hover with, but hey, it was only $3 per episode. Worth a try.

To my surprise, the [&#8220;wheel&#8221; system][10] (depicted as an actual car wheel, in-line with the series&#8217; tongue-in-cheek spirit) is arguably **better** than the mouse. It gets rid of the annoying pixel-hunting that adds little to the challenge, and comes with a bonus: muti-touching the screen reveals all clickable areas.

Happy with that, I played the whole Season 2 in a couple of weeks or so. It gave me a fever, and the only prescription was, of course, [more cowbell][11]. Being a Windows-free person, the reasonable alternative to play [Season 1][12] was to get an XBox 360 (and also a TV set &#8211; at the dawn of the on-demand video age, I had not yet bothered to buy one)

The biggest disappointment of the XBox 360 version ([available online][13]) was to find out that it uses the traditional point-and-click system, which doesn&#8217;t work as well on a gamepad. They could have at least added directional movement to one of the analog sticks. I also found the puzzles a bit too easy on the first few episodes, but overall fun. And at least I got to know how Max got his &#8220;career upgrade&#8221;.

But Sam & Max is not all about games: I&#8217;ve read [Sam & Max: Surfin&#8217; the Highway][14] massive collection of comics on comiXology, written and drawn by Steve Purcel himself, and watched a couple episodes of the [Sam & Max: Freelance Police][15] cartoon on iTunes.

The comics are awesome &#8211; I can&#8217;t help but link Steve Purcell&#8217;s style with [Wally Wood works at MAD Magazine][16], and the source from the zany ideas and humor on the games becomes clear. Not for everyone, but I found it quite entertaining.

For the cartoon, however, I had mixed feelings. First of all, the voices are quite different from the games &#8211; which also present slight variations, but always on recognizable styles. I also felt a certain washing-down of the tone which, along with the out-of-place characters, which smells like network executives &#8220;developing&#8221; the product. Still, it&#8217;s Sam & Max, so it&#8217;s good! :-)

Anyway, with several Season 1 and Season 3 episodes yet on the pipeline I still have some fun ahead (before joining the [crowds][17] asking for a Season 4), and I recommend the games (and comics) to anyone that enjoyed the original, and also for those with a taste for puzzle-solving and non-orthodox humor.
