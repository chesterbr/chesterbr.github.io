I *hate* shaving. I **really** hate it.

The only reason I shave is because I'm not much fond of facial hair either. And I've tried every single facial hair removal alternative, such as laser (hint: does not work for light-colored hair) and wax (requires growing a beard before each session, pretty much defeating the purpose; also hurts on a par with passing a kidney stone or wisdom teeth extraction).

Now you know why anyhthing with the slightest potential of making shaving suck a bit less grabs my attention - not that [Dollar Shave Club][1]'s unorthodox presentation needs any help in that regard. If you don't know what I'm talking about (or just want to laugh again), here is their [presentation video][2]:

For "$1" a month, they will send you enough blades to allow a weekly replacement. Of course, that does not include shipping (adds $2/mo), and refers to the very basic model, the "Humble Twin". Also, that is the price in the US - in Canada it gets 50c more expensive, and you pay in Canadian dollars.

Still, CAD 3.50 is an awesome deal for a month's worth of shaving - you can only get that with fixed-head disposables (the kind that is unlikely to be "f\*\*\*ing great", as [Mike][3] puts it), so I decided to give them a spin. Being a [Gillete Fusion Power][5] user, I was tempted to go straight to "4x" (their 4-blade model) or even "Executive" (a 6-blade mammoth reminescent of MADtv's [Spishak Mach 20][6]), but I wanted to test the *real* Dollar Shave, so I went with the Humble Twin.

The package arrived with a separate razor and its set of 5 cartridges. The razor is pretty decent: comfortable grip, flexible head (my biggest issue with disposables) and a firm pressure-connection system, complete with eject button. It also included a couple of lame joke cards, not nearly as fun as the video.

After shaving a few days with it, I won't say it is as good as the vibrating, 4-blade Fusion Power, but the difference was really small: with an extra pass I got the same results, which is much more than I could say of other 2-blade systems I've tried. Since they let you upgrade/downgrade your plan at any time (changing the future billing/delivery), I upped the ante and switched to the 4x, for CAD 6.50 a month - still below the Fusion price.

The switch process was easy, although I had to enter my credit card information again (apparently they need to do a new authorization, and the website confusingly warns that, for all effects, you are stopping the previous plan and starting a new one). But it worked fine - at the time I'd be receiveing a new set of 2-blade cartridges, I got a 4-blade set (with 1 less cartridge, but I suppose they last more), a new razor compatible with them, and another set of not-really-funny cards.

Once again I was positively surprised: it is nearly as good as the Fusion. The difference is small enough to be shadowed by the convenience/price, and the freshness of a new blade every week or so might even make the average shaving slightly better than with the Fusion, whose steep price makes me swap less often.

Disclosure: I get a free month if you buy it through [my link][1], which would raise suspicion - if the blades weren't so dirt cheap to begin with. That said, my veredict: I did not find it as *f\*\*\*ing great* as Mike does, but they are very good, and having a fresh one every week without any effort is a huge benefit for such a low price. With the ease of switching plans and the promise of equally easy cancellation, it is worth a shot.
