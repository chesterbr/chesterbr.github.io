**UPDATE**: Bummer! The [CEO][1] of the company behind the software (apparently, a one-man-band) has been [hired][2] by Twitter, but they don&#8217;t intend to keep the service online. :-(

**SOLUTION:** <del>[3mindme][3] is a minimalistic and efficient replacement created and mantained by [David Barrett][4]. You can send/forward email to <date>@3mindme.com (e.g., 3days@3mindme.com) and it will bounce back at the specified time. No calendar and other Sandy frills, but it fills the gap of a &#8220;snooze&#8221; button at your inbox</del>.

**NEW SOLUTION:** 3mindme also went belly up, so I'm currently using [NudgeMail](//chester.me/archives/2008/10/i_want_sandy_an.html/). It'the same thing: you send/forward e-mail to things like saturday@nudgemail.com or tomorrow5pm@nudgemail.com and it comes back to you. They are on a free beta right now and promise to continue having a free version once they get out of beta phase.

My email inbox is the most valued piece of &#8220;virtual real estate&#8221; in my life &#8211; and I am [not alone][6] in using the &#8220;act on it or archive it&#8221; approach to email. Every email that remains in my inbox is a survivor &#8211; a call-to-action item, in the best [GTD][7] style. And it works: a near-empty inbox makes me more focused, productive and relaxed.<span id="more-225"></span>

There is, however, a small crack in this routine: some emails do not require immediate action, but cannot be archived and forgotten either, and they keep lurking in my inbox, stealing bits of my attention every time I go there to check for new stuff or find higher-priority things to do.

Enter [I Want Sandy][8], a web application that combines email and calendar in a very smart way. It allows me to literally time-shift email: I just forward it to her, with a subject such as &#8220;Remind me to read this tomorrow in the afternoon&#8221;, and the email comes back at the specified time (I can be as specific as I want &#8211; [she is quite good][9] at guessing the details when I get vague).

This way I can keep in my inbox just the items to which I need to pay attention on the spot. Everything else vanishes and returns only when it is the proper time for it to be handled. And soon I started to using her to remind me of less-important things (after all, it&#8217;s just sending an email) &#8211; also uncluttering my iCal/Google Calendar.

After having been captured as a user, I started wondering &#8211; as a developer &#8211; what makes this application so interesting. Of course it uses technology in a very smart way, provides lots of [features][10] besides the ones mentioned here and has [interesting origins][11], but I strongly believe it stands out from the crowd due to three usability factors:

a) Besides supporting sophisticated ways of interaction (such as Twitter and SMS), its core is pretty much the combination of two very tried-and-true technologies (email and calendar), but in a very novel approach: by using email as an interface to calendar;

b) It presents itself in a way compatible to its paradigm shift. I know that it is an application and not a person &#8211; but the metaphor works so well that not only do I really feel as if I&#8217;m asking someone to help me rembember my stuff: I also refer to it as a person (as you have seen multiple times in this text &#8211; it&#8217;s unavoidable after you begin exchanging more emails with her than with anyone else);

c) It simply works. For every request that a cleverly constructed algorithm can reasonable be expected to undertand, it does what I expect it to do. Comparing it to clumsy, more-misses-than-hits systems (such as the ones on Google Calendar and Outlook) reminds me of the quantum leap of [going from Yahoo/AltaVista to Google][12].

(One might argue that &#8220;c&#8221; is a technology issue &#8211; but I see it more as focusing the technology efforts on the right place than anything else.)

Will it be a hit? Nobody knows. But it is a rare case of a real novel approach to an existing, &#8220;solved&#8221; problem. I would have been proud of creating it &#8211; and still hope to be able one day to help creating something as ingenious as this.
