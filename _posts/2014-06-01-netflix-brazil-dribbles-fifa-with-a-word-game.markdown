In Portuguese, the word "copa" isn't just a reference to the FIFA World Cup, or any generic cup. It is also often used to designate a pantry, or a small dining room inside a kitchen - some people even use the term interchangeably with "cozinha", the word for "kitchen".

Netflix Brazil used this in a smart [commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV1jjAmzmko) that dribbles FIFA's Orwellian (and borderline unconstitutional) countrywide media ban on expressions (which [includes things like "Christmas 2014"](http://www.worldipreview.com/article/brazil-prepares-for-ip-battle)). The spot showcases the freedom of *not* watching any important soccer match (a non-trivial luxury in Brazil, trust me) by playing entirely as a *double entendre*. Here is a rough translation:

> Guy: "You know what? I'm gonna watch Netflix on the [copa]." (grabs a tablet)
> 
> Girl: "Oh, you and this [copa], [copa], ewww."
> 
> Guy 2: "Yeah, why not on the living room?"
> 
> Guy 3: "...or the office, the bedroom, the porch..."
> 
> Guy (walking to the "copa"): "I watch Netflix WHEREVER I WANT. And I want it ON THE [copa]."
> 
> Guy 2: "So I can watch movies... on the [copa]?"
> 
> Guy 3: "...pausing and returning on the [copa]?"
> 
> Guy 4: "Watch exclusive series... on the [copa]?"
> 
> Guy: "See? Netflix changes everything!"
> 
> Narrator: "Netflix on the [copa]? Why not? Movies and series for you to watch whenever and however you want. Subscribe now."
