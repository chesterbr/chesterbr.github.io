A year ago, Ben Heck [hand-soldered an Atari 2600 on a protoboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoBcrZJA4TI) (and, as usual, [turned that into a portable console](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21qZKo0f280)). The idea of manually re-assembling the console for which I had already hacked together a [game](https://github.com/chesterbr/2048-2600) and an  [emulator](https://github.com/chesterbr/2048-2600) sounded **very** exciting (and educational) for me.

The show crew always publishes schematics for his projects, so while I waited for that, I started de-soldering the chips and cartrige conector (and a few extra components, why not?) from an old [Atari Jr.](http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2600/atari2600jr.html) board I had lying around. De-soldering is *hard*, but eventually it was done:

The schematics, however, never came. That episode's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thebenheckshow/226-tbhs-Super-Soldered-Atari-2600) only includes the original Atari's block diagram, so I shelved the plan. But more recently I stumbled upon a [series of blog posts](http://www.plingboot.com/2015/09/homebrew-6502-part-1/) in which David Barton describes how he built a 6502-based computer (a [65c02](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDC_65C02), to be precise) on a solder-less breadboard.

Those boards aren't as sturdy or portable as traditional printed circuit boards, but the freedom to tinker (and make mistakes) sparked my flame once again, so I decided to give the project another shot. I started by reproducing his first two posts, but adapted to the Atari's 6507 and adding a couple tweaks.

### Building

![solder-less breadboard ](/img/2017/09/breadboard.jpg){: .right }

The first step was to position the 6507 on the breadboard - easy, yet I managed to mess up. I aligned the 6507 first pins with the numbered tracks, which sounds smart, but leaves little space to work on the first/last pins. If you are trying this, put the chip closer to the center and save yourself the trouble.

The connections are roughly the same as Barton's project, but translated to the 6507 [pin layout](http://www.datasheetcatalog.com/datasheets_pdf/U/M/6/5/UM6507.shtml). 5V power goes to pin 4 (VCC) of the 6507, and ground goes to pin 2 (GND). There is no IRQ or NMI, so you only need two 3K resistors coming from 5V - one ending on the reset input (pin 1) and another on RDY (pin 3).

Also following him, I added a push button between the ground and the reset pin, so I could (re-)start the processor at will. The 6507 seems to work without that, but it didn't hurt. But I also added a second push button between ground and RDY - this one is more interesting, you'll see later why.

Still on his footsteps, I added the decoupling capacitor (a 100nF, 20V non-polarized ceramic) close to the power pin, to ensure clean power to the chip. Finally, I hard-wired the binary value `11101010` to the data pins, by connecting 18, 19, 20, 22 and 24 (the `1`s) to 5V and pins 21, 23 and 25 (the `0`s) to ground. It sounds like an arbitrary value, but it will _also_ make sense later. For now, just keep in mind that this makes CPU "believe" it is connected to a ROM chip where every single byte is `11101010` (or `0xEA` in hexadecimal).

The Arduino wiring consisted in matching the 6507 address lines to Arduino pins 0-12 (so we can see what address the CPU is trying to read or write), and Arduino pin 13 to âˆ…â‚€ (clock input). Here is the finished job (there is also a [higher-resolution picture](/img/2017/09/6507_full.jpg)):

**UPDATE**: Building from description may be a bit confusing (I even found a couple errors as I re-read it), so here is the [Fritzing (.fzz) drawing](/img/2017/09/6507_memory_walk.fzz):

![](/img/2017/09/6507_memory_walk.png){: .center }

You may notice the other two Atari chips above (should have labeled them "SOON" ðŸ˜Ž) and, more important, an Arduino wired to the breadboard. It has two functions:

- Generate a clock pulse (an impractically sluggish one for real usage, but great for our experience);
- Monitor the address lines, feeding the results to a trusty PC (or Mac), so we can check which memory address the CPU is trying to read.

I changed his code to read all 13 address bits on the 6507 (using Arduino's digital pins 0-12) and send the clock pulse via Arduino digital pin 13 (so I could "see" the clock pulses on my board's built-in LED, which is hard-wired to that pin).

### Playing

When I turned it on, I only got garbage.

To be precise: it worked as I expected for a few cycles, then went crazy. After pulling lots of hair that I don't have, I figured the culprit: clock speed.

Barton's code makes one clock pulse every second (i.e., 1Hz), which may be fine for a "modern" 65c02, but my old-school 6507 could not hold its state running *that* slow. Changing  `delay(1000)` to `delay(100)` on his code gave our chip a blazing 10Hz speed - fast enough for it not to get lost, yet slow enough for human eyes to watch (without an oscilloscope).

(also less than 1/100,000th of an actual Atari's speed, FWIW)

Here is the modified code ([gist](https://gist.github.com/chesterbr/a7e304aa7123dfadf613c9c2f9650891)):

<script src="https://gist.github.com/a7e304aa7123dfadf613c9c2f9650891.js"> </script>

Now comes the *really* fun part: watching the CPU work. With the power off, all pins on the address bus read as `0` bits, so the Arduino output starts like this:

```
Lower address bus : 0000000000000 : 0x0
Lower address bus : 0000000000000 : 0x0
Lower address bus : 0000000000000 : 0x0
Lower address bus : 0000000000000 : 0x0
```

When we turn the breadboard power on, things change a bit. First the CPU reads (or writes, who knows) a few addresses (most on the `0x01xx` range, hinting a stack-related operation akin to the [6502 reset](http://www.pagetable.com/?p=410)).

```
Lower address bus : 0101000000000 : 0xA00
Lower address bus : 0101000000000 : 0xA00
Lower address bus : 0000100000000 : 0x100
Lower address bus : 0000111111111 : 0x1FF
Lower address bus : 0000111111110 : 0x1FE
```

What **really** matters comes now: it reads the contents of the the addresses that match the NMI vector ([canonically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupts_in_65xx_processors#Interrupt_types) `0xFFFA` and `0xFFFB`, but we only have 13 address pins, so that will become `0x1FFA` and `0x1FFB`):

```
Lower address bus : 1111111111010 : 0x1FFA
Lower address bus : 1111111111011 : 0x1FFB
```

Honestly, I'd expect it to read the RESET vector (`0xFFFC` and `0xFFFD`). But that must be why Atari carts have all **all** vectors [pointing](https://github.com/chesterbr/2048-2600/blob/c8050d0d3c571a1740650709f60f4041e2daa68d/2048.asm#L1458-L1462) to the beginning of the code, not just RESET. Anyway, when you turn on the console, the CPU reads the address stored in those two bytes of the cartridge and starts running code from that address.

In our breadboard, the CPU will *always* read the value `0xEA` (because we wired its data bus to its binary value of `11101010`, remember?). So it assumes our "game" actually starts at the address `0xEAEA` (`1110101011101010`), and starts reading code from there.

Once again, keep in minde we only have 13 bits on the address lines, so the actual address becomes `0000101011101010`, or `0x0AEA`:

```
Lower address bus : 0101011101010 : 0xAEA
Lower address bus : 0101011101011 : 0xAEB
```

What happened now? Well, the CPU requested the contents of `0xAEA`, but our breadboard's response to any memory read is always the same: `11101010`, or `0xEA`. It just so happens that this value  is the opcode of the [NOP](http://www.obelisk.me.uk/6502/reference.html#NOP) instruction, which tells CPU to do nothing (NOP = No OPeration), and just move on to the next memory address.

So the CPU did that, reading `0xAEB`. But `0xAEB` will **also** contain an `NOP` (every address will).

Can you guess the result?

```
Lower address bus : 0101011101011 : 0xAEB
Lower address bus : 0101011101100 : 0xAEC
Lower address bus : 0101011101100 : 0xAEC
Lower address bus : 0101011101101 : 0xAED
Lower address bus : 0101011101101 : 0xAED
Lower address bus : 0101011101110 : 0xAEE
Lower address bus : 0101011101110 : 0xAEE
Lower address bus : 0101011101111 : 0xAEF
Lower address bus : 0101011101111 : 0xAEF
...
```

We see each line twice because our monitor dumps the current addres at every CPU clock cycle, and the NOP instruction takes two cycles to run. This "free run" is said to be a [rite of passage](http://uebersquirrel.blogspot.ca/2013/10/run-free-little-cpu.html) for computer builders. We had a good start, and could just pop the champagne.

But wait, there is more! Remember we added a button to pull down the RDY pin? If we press it, the CPU will ignore the clock cycles, but keep its state - in other words, it will pause.

Check it out - the CPU is there, free-running:

```
...
Lower address bus : 0101100010001 : 0xB11
Lower address bus : 0101100010010 : 0xB12
Lower address bus : 0101100010010 : 0xB12
Lower address bus : 0101100010011 : 0xB13
Lower address bus : 0101100010011 : 0xB13
Lower address bus : 0101100010100 : 0xB14
Lower address bus : 0101100010100 : 0xB14
```

Around here I pressed the button...

```
Lower address bus : 0101100010101 : 0xB15
Lower address bus : 0101100010101 : 0xB15
Lower address bus : 0101100010101 : 0xB15
Lower address bus : 0101100010101 : 0xB15
Lower address bus : 0101100010101 : 0xB15
```

...and the value doesn't change anymore, until the button is released - when it continues as nothing happened:

```
Lower address bus : 0101100010101 : 0xB15
Lower address bus : 0101100010110 : 0xB16
Lower address bus : 0101100010110 : 0xB16
Lower address bus : 0101100010111 : 0xB17
Lower address bus : 0101100010111 : 0xB17
Lower address bus : 0101100011000 : 0xB18
Lower address bus : 0101100011000 : 0xB18
...
```

For Atari programmers, this will sound familiar: Atari games need to sync their code with the scanlines that are drawn on the TV at a fixed speed, so they often write to the `WSYNC` address of TIA (the video chip) to [halt the 6507 until the next scanline starts drawing](http://www.randomterrain.com/atari-2600-memories-tutorial-andrew-davie-08.html). The TIA simply does what our finger did: sets that 6507 pin to GND until it has finished the current line.

### Next steps

My long-term goal/wish is to build an entire Atari on the breadboard. But I'm learning as I go, so who knows where I'll get?

Anyway, I *think* the next steps should be:

- Wiring the cart connector (so I could get some actual code running);
- Including the 6532 (also known as RIOT, for providing **R**AM, **I**/**O** and **T**imers);
- Adding a joystick (or some push buttons to that effect) and console switches;
- Putting a real clock (or a more powerful software one - it would be cool to change the velocity on-the-fly)
- Adding the TIA (likely the most complex part, given it will have to output the video signal somehow)

Feasible? We'll see, we'll see.
