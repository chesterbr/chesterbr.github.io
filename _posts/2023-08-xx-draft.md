Before I had my first job as a software developer, I did occasional gigs for pizza money configuring 8-bit software for small businesses - for example, I once set up AppleWorks (think of it as a prehistorical Microsoft Office) for a real estate agency, so that they could manage rental payments and automatically print invoices and receipts (trivial today, but it was a big deal in the 80s).

I was 15, and I realized each of those jobs were nearly non-transferrable,
because they were so specific to the software and hardware used, so I didn't
really think that a career would come from that. It all changed when businesses
of all sizes started to use PCs. The standardization around MS-DOS was the first
of some changes that radically changed the software development market around me.

The second one happened when I was already working full time, while still finishing a Data Processing Technical Program alongside secondary school. By then my development platform was Clipper, a dBase-like language very suited to the database-centric, single-user applications that were in high demand. However, people were starting to talk about this new software called Windows, which would make computers ridiculously easier to use (yeah, Macs were already around, but they were too expensive for most people, particularly where I lived).

Being already on the market at this time, I observed an interesting phenomenon: some developers jumped quite early on the technology (and struggled to build using primitive tools), while others stubbornly refused to leave their comfort zone and deal with GUIs, event loops and the like. Since my dream was to build general-purpose software ("products in a shrink-wrapped box that anyone in the world can use", as I called them), I knew I had to be on the first group, so when some friends started a company to build CD-ROM/"multimedia" software for those new machines, I jumped on the opportunity.

next: the internet

[I am a bit lost here: I wanted to talk about how I see AI as the next game-changer in software development, the last one being functional languages, before that the  internet and maybe before that Windows and MS-DOS, this ended up as a personal story, and I am not sure how to connect the dots. Maybe I should just write about AI and leave the rest for another post?]
