I *just* had to:

- Connect the Atari antenna output to a [Coaxial (F-type) to Female RCA adapter][1];
- Plug that in the antenna input of a the [VCR][2];
- Use 3 RCA cables to feed the VCR A/V output into an [AV-to-HDMI adapter][3];
- Connect the adapter HDMI output to the monitor;
- Configure the Atari to the "Channel 3" position;
- Select channel 3 on the VCR.

Easy, right? :-P Now I can play my homebrew ([2048 2600][4]) on the real thing.

By the way, if you want to buy a physical 2048 2600 cart, [Good Deal Games][5] sells them. I have no participation in that (other than coding the [open-source game][4] and pestering [Jenn Harrison][6] into drawing the cool cartridge front art), but I'm really happy to have my game on a real cart!
