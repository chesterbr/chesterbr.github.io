I keep wondering how Sun will apply their &#8220;expertise&#8221; in MySQL. Ideas:

*   Launching new versions with [meaningless name changes][2] to imply the idea of evolution (after all, it is &#8220;obvious&#8221; that Java = Java 1.0 or 1.1, Java2 = Java 1.2, 1.3 or 1.4 and Java5 = Java 1.5);
*   Sell the software bundled with hardware that almost nobody wants, then open source it when almost nobody cares (like Solaris);
*   Open source it under a license that simply does not allow it to be included in places other than inside other Sun products (as [they did][3] with ZFS);
*   My favorite: start a &#8220;smart&#8221; marketing campaign saying that MySQL is the &#8220;[dot in the dot-org][4]&#8221; (if you follow the link, scroll down like there was no tomorrow, they trademark huge loads of crap).

Shiny future. The only positive thing I can say about that is that we have PostgreSQL, as a last resort.
