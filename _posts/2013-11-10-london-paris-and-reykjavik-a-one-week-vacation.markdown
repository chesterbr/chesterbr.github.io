[Bani][1] noticed this winter would be one of the [best][319] to see the
[northern lights][2] in this decade. Granted, there are lots of [places in Canada][3] for that, but we decided for a stretch and went to Iceland. Adding a flight leg to
the UK was cost-effective, and I threw in a [train hop][4] into France, ending up
with a mix of Icelandic natural landscapes and urban highlights of London and Paris - two iconic
cities I always wanted to visit!

### London, UK <small>([pictures][flickr-lon])</small>

London is, as expected, a pleasant place for someone that loves Toronto as
much as I do. Sure, [imperial units][99] get in the way, and Britain could have adopted the Euro (fun fact: [Yelp][100]'s
price ranges are marked with "££" instead of "$$"), but they make up with
awesome <del>french fries</del>chips and a superior public transport system - we
had a [hop on hop off][101] ticket, but London's massive
<del>subway</del>tube and bus network is a better choice to move around.

You can purchase the [Oyster card][102] in automated
terminals at any station for £5 using your own credit card, and add
credits in £5 increments in the same way.
Fare prices vary with the distance, and you pay again if you switch systems,
but off-peak trips within a system usually go for less than £2, and it [stops charging][130] when you hit a cap. Just don't
forget to tap in and out - in particular on [DLR][120] trains, which don't
have blockades.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chesterbr/10666192645/" title="DSCN1038 by chesterbr, on Flickr"><img src="//farm6.staticflickr.com/5505/10666192645_181d5660dc_n.jpg" width="240" height="320" alt="DSCN1038" style="float:left; margin-right:12px"></a>At [Baker Street][109]'s [Canteen][103] we had some English food staples:
fish-and-chips for lunch, and tea with biscuits for dessert. Also visited the
first [Hard Rock Cafe][104] (beware weblings: no Wi-Fi on the lower level)
and had a delicious Piri Piri chicken at [Nando's][107] - surely not an
English thing, but I found this Portuguese/Mozambiquan food chain in South
Africa [a few years ago][108] and missed it since then.

The [English Breakfast][109] is good enough that I had it twice: once at
[Krüger][106] on the Financial District, and anothet at [The Tin Goose][105],
which was surprisingy good (and fast) for an airport restaurant. We also
bought some bread and cake at the [Borough Market][110] - it is not very
convenient to eat there, but is a nice choice for takeaways.

A few interesting spots were [Ada Lovelace's house][111] and the building
where the [Beatles rooftop concert][112] happened - we didn't enter any of
them, but it was nice to be there. Riding the gigantic [London Eye][113]
ferris wheel was also a a great thing to do - the lines are gigantic, but the
wheel "consumes" them quickly.

far from being the best musical (or Python-related thing) I've ever watched,
but it was fun (and appropriate to see in England). And as a special bonus,
I've also played DDR at the [London Trocadero][115]!

### Paris, France <small>([pictures][flickr-par])</small>

With just two days, I had to make the best of my time in the city.
Fortunately, a local friend offered me shelter and walked me through the
[Eiffel Tower][200], the [Arc de Triomphe][201], [Champs-Élysées][202], the
[Notre-Dame][203] and other classic attractions, also including a cup of coffee in
Paris - all on the first day!

The second day started with typical French breakfast at a cozy *boulangerie*,
followed by a [boat cruise][204] on the Seine and
an entire afternoon at the [Louvre][209]. Contrary to what I had been told, you can
get really close to the most famous artworks, such as the [Mona Lisa][205]
and the [Venus De Milo][206] (or, if you prefer, *La Gioconda* and *Aphrodite
of Milos*).

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chesterbr/10661602284/" title="Louvre by chesterbr, on Flickr"><img src="//farm4.staticflickr.com/3789/10661602284_2de6be0bac_n.jpg" width="240" height="320" alt="Louvre" style="float:left; margin-right:12px"></a>Of course, the museum goes beyond those "blockbusters", but visiting all
galleries roughly compares to walking a [quarter marathon][207], so pick a few areas
of interest and focus on them. Taking pictures is
highly encouraged, so charge your camera batteries!

The [London-Paris Eurostar][208] train is comfortable, but security and border
checks are a bit more inconvenient than I had experienced in other European trains (but not nearly as bad as an airport - just arrive half an hour
earlier and have a copy of your departure flight ticket). There is a food car, but I was happier with my own food.

### Reykjavík, Iceland <small>([pictures][flickr-ice])</small>

The main thing to see here is, of course, the [Northern Lights][300] (aka
*aurora borealis*). Those are only visible at night and away from the city
lights, so the best thing to do is to book a tour that includes some
interesting place during the day and the lights during the night.

It is a hit-or-miss: you may go out and see nothing at all. On behalf of that,
most tours will offer a second booking free of charge if the lights don't
appear, but you may want to book more than one trip anyway, since the notion of "appearing" is at their discretion.

I recommend Icelandic Mountain Guides' [Golden Circle and Magical Nights][301]: in
a single day you see [beautiful mountains, waterfalls and geysers][302]; spend
a couple of hours on a geothermal spa; have a great dinner at [Lindin][303] (the
owner is a pleasure to talk to) and chase the lights. It is really a chase: the guides from different excursions call each other and pass tips around, ensuring we can quickly move to the best spots at a given moment.

<div style="max-width:230px; float:right;margin-left:12px"><iframe width="210" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/AMT5uEFEsI8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>If you want to take pictures, make sure your camera has a configurable exposure time - anything less than 10s won't register it. My
otherwise trusty [Nikon point-and-shoot][304] didn't do the trick, but at least it
made me concentrate on seeing the thing, and there is no shortage of
[northern light photos][305] online. As a consolation prize, I [filmed][306]
a geyser.

For the less adventurous, there is Gray Line's
[City Sightseeing and The Blue Lagoon][307] tour: you see lots of significant
places around Reykjavík in the morning, then go to one of the best
geothermal spas. The [entrance fee][308] is not included, but as long as you bring
your swimsuit and towel, the basic EUR 33 allows you to enjoy the thing in
full - you can also purchase drinks on a bar *inside* the pool, if that
fancies you.

A few things you should be aware:

- Icelandic water is [heavy in sulphur][309], making it smell and taste somewhat like... eggs! It is particularly noticeable on the hot springs.

- You may feel a bit cold between the showers and the hot waters - the steam heats the air, but just a bit.

- Even though silica is [not harmful to your hair][320], Bani recommended keeping it out of the water, and I'd listen to her if I had any.

Anyway, those are just minor nuisances - I **strongly** recommend a couple of hours at Blue Lagoon. It is so relaxing that I felt my body weight for quite a minute after leaving it, like an astronaut returning to earth gravity!

The last day presented a tough choice: I could either visit the
[Icelandic Phallological Museum][310], or have lunch at [Lebowsky Bar][311].
Even though I'm as attracted to [massive galleries of phallic specimens][312]
as anyone else, [The Dude abides][313] and so did I. It was a wise
choice: nothing like a [white russian][314] to warm up in such a cold place
(burger was also nice).

Speaking of cold: temperatures are not unlike what I've endured in Canada, but
humidity plays a role in bringing the thermal sensation down, so you will want
to have [proper layered clothing][315]. I was lucky to have found a
[UNIQLO][316] store in London, where I could reinforce my inner/mid layers
with an amazing [Ultra Light Down][317] jacket, some thermals and even turtleneck
T-shirts (which I used to hate, until I tried their
[ultra-comfortable][318] stuff). Anyway, if you don't fear the cold, this is a trip you won't regret!
